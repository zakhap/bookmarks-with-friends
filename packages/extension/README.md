# Chrome Extension

## Building the Extension

```bash
pnpm build
```

This will create a `dist/` folder with the compiled extension.

## Creating Icons

Before loading the extension, you need to create icon files. For a quick MVP, you can:

1. **Use emoji screenshot:** Take screenshots of the ðŸ”– emoji at different sizes
2. **Use online icon generator:** Visit https://realfavicongenerator.net or similar
3. **Create simple colored squares** in any image editor

You need three sizes:
- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

Place them directly in `packages/extension/` directory (NOT in src/ or dist/).

Then rebuild: `pnpm build`
